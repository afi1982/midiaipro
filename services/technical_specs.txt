TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: STYLE GENERATION & GOVERNANCE (V83)
===========================================================
Objective: Strict adherence to genre physics via Governor/Conductor architecture.

1. GOA TRANCE (604)
-------------------
- Bass Mode: GATED (Intermittent flow, allows Pad breathing)
- Lead Strategy: CALL_RESPONSE (Strict 8-bar phrasing)
- Lead Scarcity: 16 Bars (Requires "Journey" silence between "Statements")
- Humanization Cap: 0.20 (Organic variance allowed)
- Density: MED (60% artificial cap on generated notes)
- Dominant Pool: Arp A (Primary), Lead A (Secondary)
- Structure: Long Intro (20%), Gradual build, Spiritual Breaks.

2. PSYTRANCE (FULL-ON)
----------------------
- Bass Mode: CONTINUOUS (K-B-B-B Rolling)
- Lead Strategy: CONTINUOUS (Constant presence)
- Lead Scarcity: 4 Bars (Frequent interaction)
- Humanization Cap: 0.15 (Tight control for drive)
- Density: HIGH
- Dominant Pool: Lead A, Acid
- Structure: Standard (Intro 10%, Drop 25%)

3. TECHNO (PEAK TIME)
---------------------
- Bass Mode: SPARSE (Rumble/Offbeat only, No rolling lines)
- Lead Strategy: MINIMAL (Textures, Stabs, No melodies)
- Lead Scarcity: 32 Bars (Very rare, high impact)
- Humanization Cap: 0.10 (Machine precision)
- Density: LOW
- Dominant Pool: Kick, Rumble
- Structure: DJ Tool (Intro 20%, Loop-based)

4. MELODIC TECHNO
-----------------
- Bass Mode: GATED (Plucks with space)
- Lead Strategy: MINIMAL (Long sustained emotional notes)
- Lead Scarcity: 16 Bars (Emotional arcs)
- Humanization Cap: 0.30 (High expression allowed)
- Density: MED

GOVERNANCE LOGIC (The "Conductor"):
1. Intent Check: Before generating a phrase, check "Bars Since Last Lead".
2. Decision: If < Scarcity Limit, FORCE REST (Silence).
3. Dominance Arbitration: If Lead A is active, Lead B is suppressed (-12dB/Silence).
